# Simple API with Spring

## Background

This project is the backend for a social media app that manages users' accounts and messages and persists that data. The purpose of this project was to learn and practice Java.

## Goals

The API should:
- allow users to register new accounts
- allow users to login to their existing accounts
- allow users to create and submit new messages
- be able to retrieve all messages
- be able to retrieve a message by its ID
- be able to delete a message by its ID
- be able to update a message by its ID
- be able to retrieve all messages submitted by a particular user

## Challenges
- Familiarizing myself with Java syntax
- Reading through Java and Spring documentation
- Learning to write tests with JUnit

## Moving Forward
- I want to learn ways to make user authentication and API usage less vulnerable to SQL injection and other threats
